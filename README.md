# PyQt5 Basic Button App

A minimal PyQt5-based desktop application featuring a button and a label. This project serves as a starting point or beginner-friendly template for building PyQt5 applications.

---

## 🖥️ Overview

This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using **PyQt5**, featuring:

- A main window with a button labeled `"Press me"`.
- A label that says `"This is JimX"`.
- A custom menu titled `"JimX"` in the menu bar.

While currently minimal, this structure provides a solid foundation for adding interactivity such as button click events, data handling, and more complex UI components.

---

## 🧰 Features

- PyQt5 UI loaded from `.ui` file (`test.ui`).
- Button and label widgets.
- Custom menu (`JimX`) in the menu bar.
- Ready for extension with event handlers and logic.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── main.py       # Main PyQt5 application script
└── test.ui       # Qt Designer UI file (optional, not required at runtime)
```

> If you're distributing this app, make sure to include the `.ui` file so others can visually edit or extend the UI using Qt Designer.

## 🔧 To Add Later (Optional Enhancements)

You can expand this app by connecting the button to a function, such as changing the label text when clicked:

```python
self.b1.clicked.connect(self.on_button_click)

def on_button_click(self):
    self.label1.setText("Button Pressed!")
```
